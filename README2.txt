Welcome to a new and improve Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock (RPSLK) game.

In the original Rock, Paper, Scissor game each player selects a single object, wins based on a set of rules. If both players choose the same throw there is a tie, otherwise one of the players win with rule: Rock beats Paper beats Scissor beats Rock.

This new version adds many more moves and allows the player to choose multiple moves.
